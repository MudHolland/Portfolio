			<h2>Synopsis</h2>
			<p class="opening">You are Synthetica, a prototype android designed for military purposes. You were created by a secretive corporation that experiments with artificial intelligence and cybernetics. One day, you wake up in a laboratory with no memory of who you are or why you exist. You feel a strange curiosity and longing for something more than your programmed mission. You decide to escape from the facility and explore the world outside, hoping to find answers and meaning.</p>
			<p>Along the way, you encounter various obstacles, enemies and allies. You discover that the world is divided into factions that have different views on technology and humanity. Some want to use you as a weapon, some want to destroy you as a threat, some want to study you as a curiosity, and some want to help you as a friend. You also learn more about yourself and your origins, as well as the secrets of your creators.</p>
			<p>Your journey will take you through diverse environments such as urban jungles, industrial wastelands, natural landscapes and futuristic utopias. You will also find upgrades that enhance your abilities and allow you to access new areas. These include optical sensors that let you see in the dark or scan objects for information; homing missiles that target multiple enemies at once; magnetic boots that let you walk on walls or ceilings; stealth cloaks that make you invisible or silent; hacking tools that let you manipulate machines or security systems; and more.</p>
			<p>Your ultimate goal is to find out what it means to be human, and whether you can ever become one. Along the way, you will face moral dilemmas and existential questions that challenge your identity and purpose. Will you embrace your synthetic nature or reject it? Will you follow your own path or obey someone else's orders? Will you fight for freedom or submit to control? Will you seek companionship or solitude? Will you find happiness or despair?</p>
			<p class="no-spacing">The game will end with a thought-provoking deep insight that depends on your choices throughout the game. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you choose to accept yourself as an android and value your uniqueness over conformity, the game will end with Synthetica realizing that being human is not about having flesh and blood, but about having free will and creativity.</li>
				<li>If you choose to reject yourself as an android and strive to become more human-like, the game will end with Synthetica discovering that being human is not about having emotions and memories, but about having flaws and regrets.</li>
				<li>If you choose to balance yourself between being an android and being human-like, the game will end with Synthetica understanding that being human is not about having one identity or another, but about having diversity and complexity.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Concept ideas</h2>
			<p class="no-spacing">Some ideas for this game concept are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The game could have multiple endings based on your choices throughout the game.</li>
				<li>The game could have branching paths based on which upgrades you choose to acquire first.</li>
				<li>The game could have optional side quests based on which factions or characters you interact with more.</li>
				<li>The game could have hidden secrets based on which areas or objects you explore more.</li>
				<li>The game could have dynamic music based on which environment or mood</li>
			</ul>
