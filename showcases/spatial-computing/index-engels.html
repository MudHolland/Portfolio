			<p class="opening">Apple's latest product, the Apple Vision Pro, has introduced us to the concept of Extended Reality (XR) and its potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital world. XR, which encompasses both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), offers a transformative approach called Spatial Computing. By seamlessly integrating transparent virtual elements into our physical surroundings, XR opens up new possibilities for interaction and immersion. As an Interaction Designer, I am thrilled to explore the future implications of XR and its capacity to reshape our relationship with the internet and connected devices.</p>
			<h3>Extended Reality: the power of the digital domain in the real world</h3>
			<p>Extended Reality is a powerful technology that enables us to break free from the confines of traditional screens and interfaces. By overlaying transparent virtual elements onto our real-world environment, XR introduces a new dimension of interactivity and immersion.</p>
			<p>Through XR, users can step into virtual worlds and explore rich, immersive experiences. Whether it's exploring ancient civilizations, traveling to distant planets, or participating in interactive storytelling, XR has the potential to transport us beyond the limitations of physical reality.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, XR empowers us to augment our physical environment with virtual information and objects. From real-time data visualizations to digital annotations in our surroundings, XR enhances our perception and understanding of the world around us.</p>
			<h3>Spatial Computing: Seamless Integration of Transparent Virtual Elements in the real world</h3>
			<p>The ability to seamlessly integrate transparent virtual elements into our physical reality is a game-changer. XR leverages cutting-edge technologies to achieve this fusion, blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical realms.</p>
			<p>Transparent virtual elements, overlaid onto transparent glass-like surfaces, allow us to view and interact with digital content while maintaining a clear view of the real world. This integration offers numerous advantages, including context-awareness, enhanced depth perception, and a heightened sense of presence.</p>
			<p>Context-awareness is a key aspect of XR, enabling virtual elements to respond intelligently to our environment. For instance, imagine walking down a street and receiving real-time information about nearby points of interest or interactive guides that enhance our exploration. This contextual layer adds depth and relevance to our experiences, making them more engaging and meaningful.</p>
			<p>Additionally, XR's accurate projection of shadows and realistic lighting effects further enhances the illusion of depth and presence. This level of realism allows us to interact with virtual objects as if they coexist with the physical world, bridging the gap between imagination and reality.</p>
			<h3>The Future Impact of Extended Reality</h3>
			<p>The convergence of XR technologies and transparent virtual elements holds immense potential for transforming our digital experiences and interactions.</p>
			<p>XR has the potential to transform entertainment and gaming experiences. From immersive storytelling to interactive gameplay, XR allows us to merge virtual worlds with our physical reality, delivering captivating and unforgettable experiences.</p>
			<p>One significant impact of XR will be in education and training. XR enables immersive simulations, virtual laboratories, and interactive learning environments that offer hands-on experiences beyond what traditional methods can provide. This technology has the power to revolutionize education by making complex concepts more tangible and engaging.</p>
			<p>In the realm of design and visualization, XR offers unparalleled opportunities. Architects can walk clients through virtual buildings, allowing them to experience spaces before they are constructed. Product designers can visualize and iterate on prototypes in real-time, enabling faster and more efficient development cycles. XR empowers us to create, iterate, and communicate ideas in ways previously unimaginable.</p>
			<h2>The possible future of Spatial Computing: A revolutionary Interface</h2>
			<h3>Gaze Tracking: The Power of Simplicity</h3>			
			<p>Gaze tracking technology represents a significant step towards simplifying XR interactions. Currently we need clunky headset, which is already a step up from the 'mobile phone strapped to the face'-concepts from 10 years ago. In the future, a lightweight and comfortable headband with built-in camera could detect the direction of your gaze, offering a natural and intuitive input method. By understanding where you are looking, devices can infer your intentions, providing a streamlined and personalized experience.</p>
			<p>With gaze tracking, the need for physical gestures or voice commands is eliminated. Interactions become effortless as you simply direct your gaze towards an object or icon to activate it. This simplicity not only reduces cognitive load but also enhances accessibility for individuals with mobility limitations.</p>
			<p>Gaze tracking enables gaze-based interaction, allowing you to control and navigate interfaces by looking at specific elements. Imagine adjusting the temperature on your induction cooker by gazing at the desired setting or selecting a cooking program on your microwave by simply focusing your gaze. This technology empowers hands-free interaction and revolutionizes the way we engage with everyday objects.</p>
			<h3>Projecting Interfaces on Everyday Objects</h3>
			<p>By projecting interfaces onto everyday objects, XR transforms them into interactive surfaces, creating a seamless blend of digital and physical worlds.</p>
			<p>Imagine appliances that project directly onto the countertop, guiding you step-by-step through the process. Visual cues, such as timers, programs and indicators, can be projected, allowing you to monitor and adjust settings with ease and hands-free, through the gaze-based input method. This projection-like interaction, combined with gaze input, simplifies complex tasks and enhances user engagement.</p>
			<p>The ability to project interfaces onto everyday objects offers endless possibilities for customization and adaptability. Users can personalize the appearance of interfaces, choose preferred interaction modes, and even project contextual information related to the task at hand. This level of flexibility ensures that XR seamlessly integrates into our daily routines.</p>
			<p>As Interaction Designers, we must embrace XR's transformative potential to craft user-centric experiences that blur the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds. The future is bright, and XR will play a pivotal role in shaping how we use and interact with the internet and connected devices.</p>
